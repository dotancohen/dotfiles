dotfiles
========

My dotfiles - Unix hidden files usually used for configuration.



TODO
----

1. Go over `env.tgz` file and add all files from there.
2. Configure `.bash-secrets` file to be included, for password aliases, that will not be added here.
3. Sort out what goes in `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`.
